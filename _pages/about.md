I'm a LGBTQ+ Java Developer currently learning Cloud! I've worked directly with Java 11+ frameworks such as Quarkus and
Springboot in several projects during almost 7 years.

Worked on banking contracts, SEFAZ (government), ERPs (TOTVS) and other services such as e-commerce product managing.
All the applications I have worked on are cloud-ready and running on IaaS.

I love my cat and my guitar!
